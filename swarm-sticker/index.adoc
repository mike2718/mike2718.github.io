|贴纸 |签到分类 |描述 

|1UP
|Arcade +
街机
|You know every NBA Jam cheat code, always Triple Buck, and would rather eat your quarter than use Raphael. Arcade or console, you're always Player One.

|7-10 Split
|Bowling Alley +
保龄球馆
|

|Ain't No Thang
|Wings Joint +
烤鸡翅店
|

|Baggs
|Food & Drink Shop
|They're out of milk, your cart's wheel is busted, and that lady has way more than 10 items! Here's hoping Baggs doesn't dump your eggs on the ground.

|Baked
|Bakery +
面包店
|Is that freshly baked bread and croissants you smell? Good thing you always roll with butter in your fifth pocket. That IS what it's for, right??

|Bargain Bin
|Thrift / Vintage Store
|I'm gonna pop some tags. Hey! found $20 in this pocket.

|Beach Bum
|Beach
|

|Berry Nice
|Farmers Market
|A fresh, locally-sourced, gluten-free, non-GMO organic sticker, picked just for you.

|Big Poppy
|Movie Theater
|This sticker's also available in IMAX 3D but it's gonna cost you another 50 check-ins. Enjoy the show, and try to ignore those teens sucking face.

|Bogey
|Golf Course
|

|Bon Appétit
|French Restaurant
|Pardon my French, but this tastes like crepe! (which is great, because that's exactly what I ordered.)

|Bookworm
|Bookstore
|Whether you're actually reading or just retreiving that flask you hid in that hollowed out novel, you're been spending a lot of time around books.

|Brie-yoncé
|Cheese Shop
|

|Clippy
|Salon / Barbershop
|Is today the day you try something new? Layers? Bangs? Frosted Tips? Mullet? Oh, we dare you! #swarmmullet

|Crafty
|Arts & Crafts Store
|Whether you're making a scrapbook of your selfies, knitting some knee warmers, or making a papier-mâché statue of your cat... you'll still be covered in glitter.

|Crushin' It
|Dive Bar
|Check in at dive bars to unlock this sticker.

|Curtain Call
|Theater
|If all the world's a stage, I wish someone would have told me to put pants on.

|Dark & Swarmy
|Cocktail Bar
|

|Do Not Disturb
|Hotel
|You don't get high thread count sheets without high germ-count remotes. Now go raid the mini-bar, cause that $12 Snickers never looked so good.
