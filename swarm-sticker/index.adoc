|Ummmm... we may or may not have tossed this entire chicken straight into the deep fryer. Whoops.

|General Tso
|Chinese Restaurant
|Those were some sweet (and sour) check-ins! Now channel your inner General Tso and order an attack on those soup dumplings.

|Happy Camper

|$50 for bags? $25 for legroom? $30 for a pillow?! At least this sticker is free. Now turn off your phone before it takes down this plane.

|Joey Beans
|Coffee Shop
|Who cares if your flat white just cost ya $10 bucks. You're getting free wi-fi! Free, extremely slow wi-fi. Drink it up.

|Jon Ham

|Juice Bar
