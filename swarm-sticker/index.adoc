|Sorry to hear you're having a crappy day. Here's a poop sticker to cheer you up. Good thing it's not scratch and sniff.

|Drained
|Uh-oh! Low battery! Thanks for sparing a little juice on this check-in. Now go find a charger so you can get back to swiping right.

|Fixie
|Sure. Keep telling your friends you just like riding bikes. But we all know you're waiting to get your driver's license back after "the incident.".

|Commuter
|You've got a seat, hot coffee and the latest Serial ready to go. Now if only... you could... untangle... these... HOW DID THEY GET SO TANGLED?!

|Shutterbug
|Forget the haters who made fun of all your food pics. They don't have this flashy new sticker! (See what we did there)? Now, which filter says \'brussel sprouts'?

|Couch Surfer
|Wow that's 5 different homes! Time to hang ten....dollars on the fridge. If you're gonna stay here you've gotta pay rent, couch surfer.

|9 to 5
|"Ummm... Yeeaahh... we're gonna need to go ahead and move you downstairs into storage B."

|Napster
|Yawn! Looks like somebody could use a cat nap. Just curl up under your desk. We'll cover for you.

|Homie
|Welcome home! Time to lose those pants and melt into your couch with a pint of cookie dough and your parents' Netflix account. Just close the blinds.

|Streaky
|Checked-in 7 days in a row... that's one heck of a streak! Time to dust off that birthday suit. Don't worry, we'll post your bail.

|Adventurer
|Let this compass guide you on your journey - cause that old GPS is gonna lead you straight into a river. Then charge $99 for new maps to get out.

|Mall Rat
|Now that you've finally got your name on rice, grab an Orange Julius and fight your way through these teenage mallrats. Wait, where'd we park the car?

|Maxed Out
|All those years playing Mall Madness are finally paying off. Here's a black card to go with all the others you maxed out today.

|Mr. Jitters
|THATSTHREECOFEESHOPSTODAY! Maybe you should consider decaf, otherwise you'll be up watching Carson Daly. We wouldn't wish that on our worst enemy.

|Crunked
|That's 4 different bars in the same night! YOLO, amirite? That is, unless you're a cat. Then, YOLNT!

|Bender
|That's 4 nights out in a row. Congrats, you've won a drink of your choice! Just tell the bartender whatever you want. And then pay for it.

|Tasty
|You sure love dining out. Can we interest you in today's special? It's a gluten-free, grass-fed, farm-to-table sticker. Enjoy!

|Foodie
|10 restaurants in 30 days? You're a real foodie! Just promise you won't join the Yelp darkside. The Internet's got enough useless one star review...&#128521;

|Chippy
|That's 3 check-ins at dessert shops! Looks like someone's got a sweet tooth. Do us a favor, don't delete your cookies. Eat them.

|Gym Rat
|10 trips to the gym in 30 days. Well done! Pound your protein shake, grab a hot shower and wreck a 20-thousand piece McNugget. You deserve it!

|Friendly
|You've checked in with 5 different friends! Time to dust off those killer mixtapes. Just make sure that last song doesn't get cut off. Rookie move.

|Rollin' Deep
|Hope you're packing some butter... \'cause you and your crew are rollin' deep. (Just try not to eat Bob.)

|Besties
|Sure you swapped heart necklaces. Maybe even kissed when you were drunk. But only the Besties sticker symbolizes true friendship.

|Swarm
|There are 50 others checked in here - this place is swarming! Good thing we make apps for people, not bees.

|Mayor Slayer
|You've dethroned 3 mayors! Nothing can stop you now. Take this killer scepter and keep bustin' crowns.

|Super Mayor
|You've held 5 mayorships at once! In the words of Uncle Ben, "with great power comes great responsibility." Or was it "fluff with fork and serve"?

|16 Candles
|Who doesn't love birthdays! Remember when your friends bought you 21 shots and you woke up in a dumpster spooning a pizza box? Yeah, neither do we.

|Ten Hundred
|Japanese legend says anyone who folds 1000 origami cranes will be granted a wish. 1000 check-ins gets you a lousy sticker. Sorry 'bout that.

|Explorer
|Vikings didn't check in on Swarm, but you sure do! 50 check-ins earned you this sweet Viking helmet and you didn't even have to settle in Greenland.

|Local
|Four times in one week at the same place? Way to plant your flag and mark your territory. You must know the owner. Hook us up with some freebies!

|Family Ties
|They've framed your entire life - from your first steps to that epicly awkward prom photo. Here's one more frame to capture this Keaton family moment.

|Overshare
|10 check-ins in 12 hours! What's next, posting a screenshot of ths sticker to Instagram and Twitter? Go ahead, try it. #swarmovershare

|Century Club
|That's over 100 days at the same place! They should hang your photo on the wall. Seriously, if they don't, just hang it up yourself.

|Charlie
|Fingers crossed you find that Golden Ticket &#129310;

|Bowtie, No Tie
|Wear that bowtie with confidence, and roar like Churchill.

|Kimchi
|Yum-yum. Just don't try to slap it on my face.

|Home Sweet Home
|Mi casa es su casa, just be sure to bring a box of wine. Clink-clink!

|What's the Tea?
|A boba a day keeps reality away, right cu-tea?

|Oh Hey
|Hello, Bonjour, Hola, Ciao, Konnichiwa, this sticker.

|Yea
|Let people know you're onboard with their plans. Please don't use this to hitchhike a ride straight to some wacko's freezer.

|Nay
|Quickly tell your friend you disapprove. Or sentence him to a Gladiator's death in the arena. Your call.

|ETA?
|When are y'all meeting up? Seems like a perfect sticker to use in Swarm messages. Remember, last one at the bar buys a round.

|Heart Container
|You see a way of saying I love you. We see 1 of 16 heart containers hidden throughout Hyrule.

|Sunny
|Suns out guns out, right? Wrong. Come on guys, unless you're mowing the lawn, keep the sleeves on.

|Stormy
|This little cloud is out to soak your socks and flip your umbrella inside out. Stay inside before you get zapped.

|I'm on a Boat
|"This ain't Seaworld, this is as real as it gets. I'm on a boat, M'er F'er, don't you ever forget!"

|Cabbie
|Does this cabbie have any idea where he's going? Snif Snif. And what on earth is that smell?! Was the last passenger a giant wet dog?

|Rails
|You don't waste your time or money in cabs. You know the fastest way around is the metro, even if it means being one with the rats.

|Vroom Vroom
|We live our lives a quarter mile at a time, especially when Waze keeps sending us down these windy backroads. Where the hell are we?!

|Newbie
|You unlocked your first sticker! (We promise, they're not all hats.) Try to collect them all, and add them to your check-ins to unlock special rewards.

|Mr. Tea
|We pit-tea the fool that steeps weak brews! (Only joking, can't we all just get oolong?)

|007
|Dry. Dirty. Shaken, not stirred. A few more of those martinis and you'll want to die another day.

|Beer?
|5pm or 5am. Suds McGee knows it's always Beer O'Clock somewhere. Whatever the time, message a friend and meet up for drinks. We won't judge.

|Oscar
|Frankly, I don't want none unless you got buns, hun. (But seriously, don't grab hot dogs off the grill and eat them with your hands, people may look at you funny.)

|Dumps
|The most bang for your buck. The best dough for your dough. Bao down to the greatest food money can buy.

|Grumpy Cat(R)
|Between October 1-15th, 2015, every time you check in we'll make a donation to Alley Cat Rescue to help save a kitty! Don't be a grump; spread the word. #EveryCheckInSavesAKitten

|Nerd
|Sure we got teased in school for playing games and collecting stickers. But look at us now! Playing games. And. Still. Collecting. Stickers.

|Miyamoto
|Happy anniversary Mario! Here's to 30 years of stomping goombas and collecting coins. But sadly, your princess is STILL in another castle.

|Slushy
|&#x1f3b6;...There must have been some CO2 in that old silk hat they found, for when they placed it on his head, he melted to the ground!..&#x1f3b6;

|Shades
|"There are two kinds of people who wear sunglasses indoors: blind people and assholes." - Larry David

|Thanks for all the edits!

|Foursquare Day
|4/16 = 4^2 = 4sqDay! Here's a sweet sticker to help you celebrate!

|Bubbles & Slosh
|Happy New Year! Cheers to all your healthy resolutions! And double cheers to the end of January, when you can go back to bragging about your 46 week bar streak.

|World Cup
|Will a massive bug land on someone's arm? Will anyone be headbutted? Will the trophy be stolen, only for a dog named Pickles to find it in a bush? Only time will tell.

|Ten-ager
|Who gave us permission to grow up so fast? Foursquare just turned 10! Thank YOU for believing in us, and here's to another 10 years!
