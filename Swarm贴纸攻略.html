<p>|Deuce |Sorry to hear you're having a crappy day. Here's a poop
sticker to cheer you up. Good thing it's not scratch and sniff.</p>
<p>|Drained |Uh-oh! Low battery! Thanks for sparing a little juice
on this check-in. Now go find a charger so you can get back to
swiping right.</p>
<p>|Fixie |Sure. Keep telling your friends you just like riding
bikes. But we all know you're waiting to get your driver's license
back after "the incident.".</p>
<p>|Commuter |You've got a seat, hot coffee and the latest Serial
ready to go. Now if only... you could... untangle... these... HOW
DID THEY GET SO TANGLED?!</p>
<p>|Shutterbug |Forget the haters who made fun of all your food
pics. They don't have this flashy new sticker! (See what we did
there)? Now, which filter says \'brussel sprouts'?</p>
<p>|Couch Surfer |Wow that's 5 different homes! Time to hang
ten....dollars on the fridge. If you're gonna stay here you've
gotta pay rent, couch surfer.</p>
<p>|9 to 5 |"Ummm... Yeeaahh... we're gonna need to go ahead and
move you downstairs into storage B."</p>
<p>|Napster |Yawn! Looks like somebody could use a cat nap. Just
curl up under your desk. We'll cover for you.</p>
<p>|Homie |Welcome home! Time to lose those pants and melt into
your couch with a pint of cookie dough and your parents' Netflix
account. Just close the blinds.</p>
<p>|Streaky |Checked-in 7 days in a row... that's one heck of a
streak! Time to dust off that birthday suit. Don't worry, we'll
post your bail.</p>
<p>|Adventurer |Let this compass guide you on your journey - cause
that old GPS is gonna lead you straight into a river. Then charge
$99 for new maps to get out.</p>
<p>|Mall Rat |Now that you've finally got your name on rice, grab
an Orange Julius and fight your way through these teenage mallrats.
Wait, where'd we park the car?</p>
<p>|Maxed Out |All those years playing Mall Madness are finally
paying off. Here's a black card to go with all the others you maxed
out today.</p>
<p>|Mr. Jitters |THATSTHREECOFEESHOPSTODAY! Maybe you should
consider decaf, otherwise you'll be up watching Carson Daly. We
wouldn't wish that on our worst enemy.</p>
<p>|Crunked |That's 4 different bars in the same night! YOLO,
amirite? That is, unless you're a cat. Then, YOLNT!</p>
<p>|Bender |That's 4 nights out in a row. Congrats, you've won a
drink of your choice! Just tell the bartender whatever you want.

special? It's a gluten-free, grass-fed, farm-to-table sticker.
Enjoy!</p>
<p>|Foodie |10 restaurants in 30 days? You're a real foodie! Just
promise you won't join the Yelp darkside. The Internet's got enough
useless one star review...&amp;#128521;</p>

someone's got a sweet tooth. Do us a favor, don't delete your
cookies. Eat them.</p>
<p>|Gym Rat |10 trips to the gym in 30 days. Well done! Pound your
protein shake, grab a hot shower and wreck a 20-thousand piece
McNugget. You deserve it!</p>
<p>|Friendly |You've checked in with 5 different friends! Time to
dust off those killer mixtapes. Just make sure that last song
doesn't get cut off. Rookie move.</p>
<p>|Rollin' Deep |Hope you're packing some butter... \'cause you
and your crew are rollin' deep. (Just try not to eat Bob.)</p>
<p>|Besties |Sure you swapped heart necklaces. Maybe even kissed
when you were drunk. But only the Besties sticker symbolizes true
friendship.</p>
<p>|Swarm |There are 50 others checked in here - this place is
swarming! Good thing we make apps for people, not bees.</p>
<p>|Mayor Slayer |You've dethroned 3 mayors! Nothing can stop you
now. Take this killer scepter and keep bustin' crowns.</p>
<p>|Super Mayor |You've held 5 mayorships at once! In the words of
Uncle Ben, "with great power comes great responsibility." Or was it
"fluff with fork and serve"?</p>
<p>|16 Candles |Who doesn't love birthdays! Remember when your
friends bought you 21 shots and you woke up in a dumpster spooning
a pizza box? Yeah, neither do we.</p>
<p>|Ten Hundred |Japanese legend says anyone who folds 1000 origami
cranes will be granted a wish. 1000 check-ins gets you a lousy
sticker. Sorry 'bout that.</p>

check-ins earned you this sweet Viking helmet and you didn't even
have to settle in Greenland.</p>

your flag and mark your territory. You must know the owner. Hook us
up with some freebies!</p>
<p>|Family Ties |They've framed your entire life - from your first
steps to that epicly awkward prom photo. Here's one more frame to
capture this Keaton family moment.</p>
<p>|Overshare |10 check-ins in 12 hours! What's next, posting a
screenshot of ths sticker to Instagram and Twitter? Go ahead, try
it. #swarmovershare</p>
<p>|Century Club |That's over 100 days at the same place! They
should hang your photo on the wall. Seriously, if they don't, just
hang it up yourself.</p>
<p>|Charlie |Fingers crossed you find that Golden Ticket
&amp;#129310;</p>
<p>|Bowtie, No Tie |Wear that bowtie with confidence, and roar like
Churchill.</p>

<p>|Home Sweet Home |Mi casa es su casa, just be sure to bring a
box of wine. Clink-clink!</p>
<p>|What's the Tea? |A boba a day keeps reality away, right
cu-tea?</p>
<p>|Oh Hey |Hello, Bonjour, Hola, Ciao, Konnichiwa, this
sticker.</p>
<p>|Yea |Let people know you're onboard with their plans. Please
don't use this to hitchhike a ride straight to some wacko's
freezer.</p>
<p>|Nay |Quickly tell your friend you disapprove. Or sentence him
to a Gladiator's death in the arena. Your call.</p>
<p>|ETA? |When are y'all meeting up? Seems like a perfect sticker
to use in Swarm messages. Remember, last one at the bar buys a
round.</p>
<p>|Heart Container |You see a way of saying I love you. We see 1
of 16 heart containers hidden throughout Hyrule.</p>
<p>|Sunny |Suns out guns out, right? Wrong. Come on guys, unless
you're mowing the lawn, keep the sleeves on.</p>
<p>|Stormy |This little cloud is out to soak your socks and flip
your umbrella inside out. Stay inside before you get zapped.</p>
<p>|Fiery |When your phone screen cracks. When Seamless is an hour
late. When your Uber driver keeps making wrong turns. WHERE IS HE
GOING?!</p>
<p>|Bessie |You're now the protector of Bessie, the last unicorn on
Earth. No pressure.</p>
<p>|Endeavour |NASA launches rockets. We launches stickers. Here's
to you, NASA. Keep exploring.</p>
<p>|Back to the future |Great Scott! It's 10.21.15 - the day Marty
McFly visited in Back to the Future! Sure they predicted FaceTime
but WHERE ARE OUT HOVERBOARDS?!</p>
<p>|I'm on a Boat |"This ain't Seaworld, this is as real as it
gets. I'm on a boat, M'er F'er, don't you ever forget!"</p>
<p>|Cabbie |Does this cabbie have any idea where he's going? Snif
Snif. And what on earth is that smell?! Was the last passenger a
giant wet dog?</p>
<p>|Rails |You don't waste your time or money in cabs. You know the
fastest way around is the metro, even if it means being one with
the rats.</p>
<p>|Vroom Vroom |We live our lives a quarter mile at a time,
especially when Waze keeps sending us down these windy backroads.
Where the hell are we?!</p>
<p>|Newbie |You unlocked your first sticker! (We promise, they're
not all hats.) Try to collect them all, and add them to your
check-ins to unlock special rewards.</p>
<p>|Mr. Tea |We pit-tea the fool that steeps weak brews! (Only
joking, can't we all just get oolong?)</p>
<p>|007 |Dry. Dirty. Shaken, not stirred. A few more of those
martinis and you'll want to die another day.</p>
<p>|Beer? |5pm or 5am. Suds McGee knows it's always Beer O'Clock
somewhere. Whatever the time, message a friend and meet up for
drinks. We won't judge.</p>
<p>|Oscar |Frankly, I don't want none unless you got buns, hun.
(But seriously, don't grab hot dogs off the grill and eat them with
your hands, people may look at you funny.)</p>
<p>|Dumps |The most bang for your buck. The best dough for your
dough. Bao down to the greatest food money can buy.</p>
<p>|Grumpy Cat(R) |Between October 1-15th, 2015, every time you
check in we'll make a donation to Alley Cat Rescue to help save a
kitty! Don't be a grump; spread the word.
#EveryCheckInSavesAKitten</p>

anything other than running.</p>

without breaking a sweat (or having to pee in a cup!)</p>
<p>|Nerd |Sure we got teased in school for playing games and
collecting stickers. But look at us now! Playing games. And. Still.

your sleep. Now please, take off the headset and join us IRL. Your

old silk hat they found, for when they placed it on his head, he
melted to the ground!..&amp;#x1f3b6;</p>
<p>|Shades |"There are two kinds of people who wear sunglasses
indoors: blind people and assholes." - Larry David</p>

get that snow day.</p>
<p>|Superuser |Thanks for all the edits!</p>
<p>|Foursquare Day |4/16 = 4^2 = 4sqDay! Here's a sweet sticker to
help you celebrate!</p>
<p>|Leap Day William |In 46 B.C. Caesar added Leap Years to stop
people from adding and removing days from the calendar. We're
pretty happy about his work in the salad world as well.</p>
<p>|Rosey |Roses are red. Violets are blue. In the words of Ralph
Wiggum, I choo-choo-choose you!</p>
<p>|Braaains |</p>
<p>|Bludolph |Naughty or nice? Bludolph doesn't care! We're sending
him your way to wish you a Merry Christmas no matter what you've
been up to this year!</p>

resolutions! And double cheers to the end of January, when you can
go back to bragging about your 46 week bar streak.</p>
<p>|World Cup |Will a massive bug land on someone's arm? Will
anyone be headbutted? Will the trophy be stolen, only for a dog
named Pickles to find it in a bush? Only time will tell.</p>

just turned 10! Thank YOU for believing in us, and here's to
another 10 years!</p>
